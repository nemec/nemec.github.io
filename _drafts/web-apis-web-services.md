* Adoption of JSON (human-readable)
* Focus on documentation (devs need to be able to read/understand)
* API -> POS dev -> Restaurant -> customer analogy
* It's not just about how quick API is developed, nor what features it enables for customer
	* need to ensure onboarding and developing against an API is fast, easy, and effective.
	* APIs, by definition are not end-user products.
* Want machine-readable? Hypermedia and/or APIs.json. SDKs.
	* Important that machine readability comes second to ease of use for humans (both would be good though)
	* AI doesn't make products (yet), humans do.
