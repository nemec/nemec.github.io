##Don't abandon all hope

Luckily, you don't have to choose between privacy and your ability to share
your special day with friends and family. Nor do you have to hire someone
to write one for you (or do it yourself!). The Knot, at least, offers up
[a simple switch](http://feedback.beta.theknot.com/knowledgebase/articles/503923-remove-your-wedding-website-from-search-engines)
to tell search engines not to include it in your search results. It is
ultimately up to you (and your sweetheart) to decide whether you want strangers
to be able to find your wedding site and it's also undeinably convenient -- a
guest who gets lost on the way to your venue can simply Google your name instead
of searching past conversations for the link you sent them -- but at the very
least I'd recommend hiding the page once your wedding festivities wrap up.

It's true that once something appears online, it's probably there for eternity
thanks to the variety of archival "mirror" sites, but that doesn't mean you
should offer up your data on a silver platter if you can help it.

##After the honeymoon

Once you've got your wedding squared away, it may be prudent to perform some
spring cleaning on [the rest of your digital footprint]({% post_url audit-your-digital-footprint %}).
