    organize music?

* Streaming is now the primary music vehicle.
* No more buying a set of songs, have access to vast catalog of music.
* Still the only way to browse music is by Artist/Album
* The latest hotness is machine learning, algorithms, but we still have
  room to grow in "prescriptive" classification.
* Those two rigid concepts ignore the nuances of modern music
  * Featured artists
  * Sampling and remixes
* Singles account for duplicate songs when full album comes out
  * Why not merge singles into album (+ play stats)?
* We need to expand the graph to take advantage of the massive catalog.
* Graph edges
  * Inspired by
    * Perfect way to let the artists themselves comment on who inspires their music
    * Personalized to artist
  * Cover
    * Link from song to all covers of that song (and similar edges back in)
    * Allows you to find new, often unknown bands
    * Encourages linking back to original song
  * Featuring
    * Current streaming systems make it impossible to browse a list of songs
      where the artist (usu vocalist) is featured -- often just as good as a
      new song by the artist
  * Collaborations
    * Some systems list collabs as "Artist A & Artist B", preventing you from
      finding the song when browsing *either* artist's page
  * Samples
    * Discover what makes a song tick, depth of music
    * Discover entirely new genres, how an artist can transform a song
    * Discover all artists that have sampled a particular song
  * Remixes
    * Why can't I take a song and browse all remixes?
    * Discover artists that have remixed other songs (similar to sampling)
    * Promote remixer/mashup artists to "first class" artists.
  * Also Member Of
    * Links to other bands where the members of a band overlap
    * Member leaving a band to become a solo artist (and the opposite)
