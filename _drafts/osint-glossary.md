# Intro


Hello, welcome to my attempt to build an "OSINT Glossary" - a document defining
terms you may commonly hear spoken about in the OSINT community, especially 
some of the more technical concepts. When you venture into "open sources" of
data on the internet, eventually you'll find yourself digging into intermediate
to advanced technical concepts to find additional sources of data that may not
be easily found on the "surface" of a search engine. At the same time, many
people involved in the OSINT field come from diverse walks of life and it can
easily be overwhelming to come up to a wall of acronyms and jargon that you
don't understand.

There is already a lot of good "intro to OSINT" content out in the world, but
it seems most of the content explaining what, exactly a concept or term means
is spread across hundreds of blog posts and videos. I'd like to build this
resource to gather all the terms in one place, spend a short amount of time
describing what the term means and why it's relevant to OSINT, and sometimes
leave you with further reading on the topic. I will, as best I can, avoid
talk of specific "tools" because, as awesome as they are, inevitably tools
will fall into disrepair due to lost interest, lack of profitability, or
the data source they rely upon is closed or otherwise made unavailable.

# How to use this glossary

This isn't a traditional A-Z glossary, although I will try to create a listing
summary if my blog software will let me. I'm going to try grouping related terms
and concepts together into categories, so if you want to know more about a
topic, feel free to read this article "book-style". Otherwise, if you're
looking for a specific term just hit `Ctrl+F` and search for it on the page.
If you don't see what you're looking for but feel it belongs in this guide,
feel free to reach out to me and I'll see if I can get it added. Enjoy!
